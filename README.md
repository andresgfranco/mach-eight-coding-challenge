# Mach Eight coding challenge - By: Andrés González Franco
In this repository you will find the solution for the Mach Eight coding challenge.

# Considerations
- Write a function that finds pairs of integers from a list that sum to a given value. The function will take as input the list of numbers as well as the target sum.
- You can assume that all input values are integers.
- You can assume that there aren't any repeat values in the list.
- The algorithm to find the pairs must be faster than O(n^2).
- All edge cases should be handled appropriately.

# Requirements
- Python 3.x versions.

# How to use it
- Clone this GitHub repository into your VM or OS with `git clone https://github.com/andresgfranco/mach-eight-coding-challenge.git`
- If python is not installed in your VM or OS yet, feel free to follow the corresponding instructions and install it before continuing here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Since there is no need to run or start an app, once in the directory feel free to run this command `python -m unittest tests.py`.
- In the CLI output you will find the tests results as well as the output of each test.

# Files in this repository
- `README.md`
- `app.py:` module containing the main function find_pairs_sum.
- `tests.py:` module containing the unit tests to handle each edge case.
